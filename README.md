# Automation-Testing
Automation testing is a software testing technique that employs specialized tools and scripts to execute pre-defined test cases, compare actual outcomes with expected results, and report any discrepancies. Unlike manual testing, which relies on human intervention, automation testing streamlines repetitive and time-consuming tasks, improving efficiency and reducing the likelihood of human errors. It is particularly beneficial for regression testing, where repeated validation of unchanged functionalities is required. Automation testing enhances test coverage, accelerates the testing process, and enables continuous integration and delivery in software development. Overall, it contributes to higher software quality, faster release cycles, and cost-effectiveness in the long run.
